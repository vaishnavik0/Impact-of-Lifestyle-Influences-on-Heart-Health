## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease from clinical and lifestyle data, focusing on the critical issue of imbalanced datasets. Techniques such as Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting were employed within a MultiOutputClassifier framework to improve predictions and handle data skewness.

## Research Paper
Accompanying this project is a detailed research paper that outlines the applied methodologies, particularly our approach to managing imbalanced data using advanced metrics like F1-score and AUC-ROC. The paper discusses how these methods enhance model sensitivity and specificity, ensuring robust predictive performance.

## Key Achievements
- **Model Performance:** Achieved an F1-score of 0.6413 for top category prediction, with significant improvements in predictive recall and precision.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Developed strategies to effectively manage imbalanced datasets, enhancing model accuracy and reliability.
- **Research Contribution:** Authored a comprehensive research paper that contributes to the predictive analytics field, particularly in healthcare.
